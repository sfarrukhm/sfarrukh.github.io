<p> I'm deeply interested in Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Over time, I've been exploring these areas, learning concepts on my own, and working on projects where I fine-tune and pretrain models for different applications. My background in engineering has helped me develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I now apply to AI-related challenges. Iâ€™m excited about using AI to find practical solutions to real-world problems and continuously expanding my knowledge in this field. </p>
